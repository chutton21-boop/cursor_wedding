# Project: Wedding website
Goal: a simple, elegant wedding site that works on mobile.

## Rules
- Keep changes small and explain what you changed.
- Use Next.js App Router + Tailwind.
- Keep components simple; avoid extra libraries unless necessary.

## Pages needed
- Home (hero + date/location + CTA)
- Details (schedule, travel, FAQ)
- RSVP (simple form)
- Registry (links)
- Photos (optional)

## Style
- Minimal, modern, black/white with one accent color.
- Accessible (good contrast, readable type, large tap targets).

## Strict clone mode
- The selected Figma frame is the single source of truth.
- Do not invent new sections, pages, copy, or components.
- Do not change IA (only Home / Details / FAQ / RSVP).
- If something is ambiguous, ASK instead of guessing.
- Prefer CSS-only changes before touching HTML structure.
- Keep diffs small: max ~100 lines per iteration.
